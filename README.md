# crystal-game

## Using jQuery

This is my first project using jQuery. 

## How it works

When loading the page, each of the crystals is given a random value attribute of 1-12. No two crystals will have the same value in any game. 

The target score that must be achieve is a randmoly generated number from 19-120. 

Upon winning or losing the game, the wins and losses will be updated, the counter will be reset, and a new target number will be randomly generated, all without any additional user input or the need to restart a game. 

## Languages Used

This game was created with the use of the following languages and libraries:
HTML5
CSS
BootStrap
jQuery
Javascript

## Hat Tip
Special thanks to my classmate, Ben, who helped fix an issue with the game reset function.
